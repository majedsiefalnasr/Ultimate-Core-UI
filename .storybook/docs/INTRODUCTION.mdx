# Anchor UI — Storybook Introduction

This document explains how to use and contribute to the Storybook documentation for the Anchor UI component library. The project uses Vue 3 (Composition API), Vuetify, Vite, and Storybook. Follow the conventions below to keep stories consistent, discoverable, and well-documented.

## Purpose

- Provide interactive, visual documentation for all UI components in `src/components/`.
- Serve as the canonical place for component usage examples, prop docs, accessibility notes, and design tokens (styles).
- Help designers, developers, and QA test and interact with components in isolation.

## Project conventions (must-follow)

- Components live under `src/components/ComponentName/` and export a folder index (e.g., `src/components/AButton/index.ts`).
- Each component folder should contain:
  - `ComponentName.vue` — the Vue Single File Component using Composition API.
  - `ComponentName.stories.ts` — Storybook stories and docs for the component.
  - `ComponentName.test.ts` — Vitest unit tests (happy path, edge case, failure case).
  - `index.ts` — Re-export for the component.
- Story file naming: `ComponentName.stories.ts` (PascalCase matches component name).
- Use `<script setup lang="ts">` and define props and emits with types.
- Style files should use SCSS modules or `<style scoped lang="scss">`.

## Story structure and recommended patterns

Each story file should follow this pattern:

- Default export: component title + meta args
- ArgTypes: document controls with types and descriptions
- Primary (default) story: simple usage showing `props` children
- Variants: one-arg changes that demonstrate a property or slot
- Accessibility story: show aria attributes, keyboard interactions
- Docs: use Storybook Docs blocks to explain purpose, props, and examples

Example skeleton (TypeScript + Vue 3):

- Default export (title: `Components/ComponentName`)
- args: default props
- Story functions: return component template and args

## Doc sections to include in each story

- Purpose: Short sentence explaining the component's intent.
- API / Props table: include types, default values, descriptions.
- Events: list emitted events and payload shapes.
- Slots: describe named/default slots and usage.
- Accessibility: ARIA roles, keyboard guidance, focus management.
- Design tokens: reference theme variables or SCSS variables when relevant.

## Writing docs (best practices)

- Keep examples small and focused. Prefer multiple small stories over one large mega-story.
- Use realistic data in examples, but avoid business secrets or private strings.
- Add small code snippets to show common patterns.
- When showing layout or spacing, prefer story decorators or wrapper components.
- For interactive examples, use Storybook controls via `args` instead of inline knobs.

## Testing & QA

- Each component must include a `*.test.ts` file using Vitest + Vue Testing Library.
- Tests should include at least:
  - one happy-path rendering/interaction test
  - one edge-case test (missing props, empty slot)
  - one failure/validation case (invalid props, emit errors)
- Run tests locally with the project test runner (see `package.json` scripts).

## Running Storybook locally

If Storybook is already configured in the project, start it with the repository scripts in `package.json` (typically `npm run storybook` or `yarn storybook`). If that script is missing, consult `README.md` and the Storybook configuration under `.storybook/`.

## Adding a new component + stories (step-by-step)

1. Create component folder: `src/components/YourComponent/`.
2. Implement `YourComponent.vue` using Composition API and typed props.
3. Add `index.ts` re-export and update `src/components/index.ts` to re-export your component.
4. Add `YourComponent.stories.ts` with the required sections (see "Story structure").
5. Add `YourComponent.test.ts` with Vitest tests.
6. Run linters, tests, and Storybook to verify the component renders and docs appear.

## Accessibility checklist (quick)

- Ensure focusable elements have visible focus styles.
- Provide ARIA roles/labels where semantic elements are insufficient.
- Ensure keyboard navigation works for interactive components.
- Test with screen readers when possible.

## Troubleshooting

- If stories don't show up, verify file name matches `*.stories.ts` and the title doesn't collide with another story.
- If Prop controls don't appear, check `argTypes` and that props are exposed in the default export args.
- Check console for errors — sometimes missing peer-dependencies (Vue/Vuetify) cause silent failures.

## Contributing guidelines

- Add or update Storybook docs when you add or change components.
- Keep stories focused, and follow the naming conventions.
- Update `README.md` and `BRIEF.md` if you add major patterns or structural changes.

## Where to edit Storybook configuration

Storybook configs live under `.storybook/`.

- `main.ts` — addons, stories glob, webpack/vite config
- `preview.ts` — global decorators, parameters, styles
- `INTRODUCTION.md` — this file

## FAQ

Q: Where should I add global CSS for stories?
A: Add it in `.storybook/preview.ts` or import the main stylesheet from `src/styles/index.scss` in `preview.ts`.

Q: How do I document a composable or utility that's not a component?
A: Create a docs-only story (MDX or `*.stories.ts`) under `Docs/` with code examples and exports.

If you'd like, I can also:

- Add a pointer in `README.md` that links to this introduction.
- Generate a story skeleton template file to speed up adding new components.
